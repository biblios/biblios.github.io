## Multiple Drafts Plugin

I was pondering on how to best create posts. I have quite a reluctance to write and have always failed at keeping diary entries. As yet I'm not sure how this project will develop - I guess it'll be mostly prompts for recalling how I did a homelab something. It'll be good practice to try writing clear documentation (something I could do with doing in a work context re:bookbinding)

On writing a post its useful for me to have a staging point ie. _drafts. Where the post can be knocked up. I came across a [jekyll plugin](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/jekyll-plugin/) that should publish the post inserting date front matter.

So here goes an exercise in a post written to draft then published by plugin.
