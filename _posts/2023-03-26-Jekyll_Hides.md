Spending time trying to absorb how to configure jekyll in order to understand the chirpy template. Reading through docs and looking at how other sites have employed this template. Here be some places of interest:

- Image Gallery

  - [jekyll-gallery-generator](https://github.com/ggreer/jekyll-gallery-generator)

  - [hyperionmedia.us](https://hyperionmedia.us/posts/jekyll-chirpy-image-gallery/)

  also check out

  - [jekyll codex](https://jekyllcodex.org/without-plugin/image-gallery/)


Header images (placed in front matter) should be resized to 1200 x 630 px.

- Favicon
  - [chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/customize-the-favicon/)
  - [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/)
  
  
  nb: not too clear which directory to change?

  update: Eventually realised that multiple folders from the gem jekyll theme folder were required to be copied into the root folder of the repository.
